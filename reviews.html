              <p class="testing__txt">
                But let's start at the very beginning. Not only how we taste
                chocolate is important, but also in which order. Perhaps you
                have already had the pleasure of a wine tasting at some point in
                your life. As with wine, we start our chocolate tastings with
                the lightest white chocolate product, followed by milk
                chocolate. We only taste the dark chocolate varieties at the
                end, as their intensity would drown out the finer notes of the
                light varieties and you would no longer be able to taste the
                multi-layered aromas.
              </p>
              <p class="testing__txt">
                When it comes to the actual tasting, we always use our five
                senses. We start with our eyes. Look at the chocolate bar, the
                praline or the SchoggiPlättli. Is the surface nice and smooth
                and does it have a nice sheen? Then your sense of touch comes
                into play. Chocolate should feel firm and smooth in your hands.
                As soon as it has landed in your mouth, it can melt with
                pleasure. And don't forget your sense of hearing. Especially if
                you have a chocolate bar in front of you, it should make a nice
                cracking sound when you break it next to your ear. This
                indicates that the chocolate has been well stored and carefully
                processed. As a fourth sense, our nose is of course also very
                important. Do you smell the products first, what notes and
                tastes can you make out? In many cases, flavors even seem more
                intense or different to us when we perceive them only with our
                nose. Finally, we dedicate ourselves extensively to our sense of
                taste. Let the products slowly melt in your mouth and use your
                tongue to absorb all the different tastes that the product
                offers you. This doesn't just mean ingredients like fruits or
                nuts, but also the different flavors you can taste from the
                chocolate itself. From fruity sweet to smoky and tart, the
                spectrum of cocoa bouquets and intensities is huge.
